    <h1 class="text-2xl">Hello! I'm Zahid Galea ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        Born in Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª, seeking new opportunities, I moved to Santiago, Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± at the age of 20 and
        have been living in Buenos Aires, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· for the past 2 years.
        <br><br>
        My curiosity and passion
        for technology first led me to delve into the world of "FullStack" in 2017 and later
        into the world of "machine learning" in mid-2018. Since then,
        life has steered me primarily towards the paths of architecture and "data engineering."
        <br><br>
        I've been fortunate to work in various sectors such as banking, telecommunications, and consulting, which has
        allowed me to face varied challenges and enrich my experience. I am an enthusiast of software
        engineering and am always looking to try out new technologies.
        <br>
        <br>
        My professional journey has led me to roles in DevOps, DataOps, data engineering, Fullstack development,
        and more. I love automating processes and exploring management and data architecture tools. I'm always ready for
        a new challenge!
        <br>
        <br></p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl">A bit about my "B" side </h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        As a kid, I spent several years dedicated to playing the piano and soccer, but if there's something that truly
        captivates me, it's E-Gaming.
        I started on a PC that could barely run Counter Strike at 10 fps, which led me to my first forays into
        computing.
        <br>
        <br>
        I won't lie, I was never the class nerd, but I feel that I have the ability to pick things up quickly and
        to be a generalist.
        <br>
