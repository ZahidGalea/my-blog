# BigQuery Pro Tips for Data Engineering

BigQuery is a powerhouse for data analytics, offering scalable, serverless data processing and SQL-like capabilities.
Here are some pro-tips that I've found invaluable for optimizing performance and managing costs effectively.

## 1. Leveraging Partitioning and Clustering

### Partitioning

- **Use Date/Time-based partitioning** for tables with a time dimension. This dramatically reduces the amount of data
  scanned in queries, lowering costs and improving performance.
- **Consider Integer Range Partitioning** for non-date columns with a high cardinality but predictable range.

### Clustering

- **Combine Clustering with Partitioning** to further reduce query costs by organizing data within each partition.
- **Choose up to four columns for clustering**, prioritizing those you frequently filter or join on.

## 2. Cost Control and Optimization

### Avoid Select *

- **Be explicit with column selection** to minimize data processed. `SELECT *` is convenient but costly in large
  datasets.

### Use Preview Options

- **Preview data before querying** with `bq show --schema` or the web UI to understand your data and avoid unnecessary
  scans.

### Monitor and Manage Query Costs

- **Set up cost controls** at the dataset or project level to prevent budget overruns.
- **Review the Query Plan** to understand how BigQuery executes your query and identifies potential optimizations.

## 3. Performance Tuning

### Smart Materialization

- **Materialize intermediate results** in temporary tables for complex multi-step queries. It can save processing time
  and costs for repeated operations.

### Optimize Joins

- **Use the right join strategy**: BigQuery automatically selects a join strategy, but you can influence this with the
  structure of your query.
- **Reduce data before joining**: Filter or aggregate data prior to joining to minimize the amount of data being
  processed.

### Query Caching

- **Leverage query caching**: Repeated queries return cached results for quick retrieval, provided the underlying data
  hasn't changed. Note that this doesn't apply when using non-deterministic functions like `NOW()`.

## 4. Efficient Data Loading and Storage

### Use the Right Data Formats

- **Prefer Parquet and ORC** for efficient storage and faster queries, especially for complex nested data structures.

### Batch Data Loading

- **Load data in large batches** rather than streaming for cost efficiency. Streaming data is powerful for real-time
  needs but comes at a higher cost.

### Optimize Storage

- **Regularly clean up old data** with partition expiration settings to manage storage costs.
- **Compress and deduplicate data** where possible to reduce storage volume.

These tips have been game-changers in my work with BigQuery, helping to manage large datasets efficiently while keeping
costs in check. Always keep exploring and testing; BigQuery is continuously evolving, offering new ways to optimize data
processing and analytics.
