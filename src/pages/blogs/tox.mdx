# What is Tox?

Tox is a test automation tool that simplifies running unit tests, linting, type checking, and code formatting in multiple virtual environments. With Tox, you can easily define the dependencies and commands needed for each task in a tox.ini configuration file.

### Benefits of Using Tox
* Ensures consistency in running tests and other tasks across different environments.
* Facilitates continuous integration by automating testing and linting.
* Allows running tests on multiple Python versions with a single configuration.
* Simplifies virtual environment setup and dependency installation.

### Example Tox Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure Tox to run unit tests (coverage report for sonarqube), linting, type checking, and code formatting:

```ini
[tox]
requires =
    tox>=4
env_list = pytest, lint, type, format, py{310}

[testenv:pytest]
description = run unit tests
deps =
    pytest
    coverage
    -r src/{posargs}/requirements.txt
commands =
    coverage run -m pytest tests/test_{posargs}.py
    coverage xml -o {posargs}_coverage.xml

[coverage:run]
relative_files = True
source = ./
branch = True

[testenv:format]
description = install black in a virtual environment and invoke it on the current folder
deps =
    black==22.12
    black[jupyter]
skip_install = true
commands = black .

[testenv:lint]
description = run linters
skip_install = true
deps =
    black==22.12
    black[jupyter]

commands = black --check .

[testenv:type]
description = run type checks
deps =
    mypy>=0.991
commands =
    mypy tests
```

### Snippets annotations

* Set many env list as required, if you want to test multiple python versions, add it to the env_list

  ```ini
  [tox]
  env_list = py{310, 39, 38, 37}
    ```

* Use the deps option under [testenv] to specify dependencies that apply to all environments.

  ```ini
  [testenv]
  deps =
      pytest
      coverage
      black==22.12
      mypy>=0.991
    ```

### Practical Usage

1) Install Tox in your development environment: pip install tox
2) Create a tox.ini file in the root of your project and configure the sections according to your needs.
3) Run Tox to perform the defined tasks: 
    ```bash
    tox # To run everything
    tox -e pytest # To run only the pytest environment
    tox -e format # To run only the format environment
    ```
4) Pass arguments to the commands using the posargs placeholder, for example:
    ```ini
    [testenv:pytest]
    description = run unit tests
    deps =
        pytest
        coverage
        -r src/{posargs}/requirements.txt
    commands =
        coverage run -m pytest tests/test_{posargs}.py
        coverage xml -o {posargs}_coverage.xml
    ```
    ```bash
    tox -e pytest -- lambda_folder
    ```


When you run Tox, it will create virtual environments for each specified Python version and execute the commands defined in the corresponding sections. This allows you to ensure that your code works across different Python versions and environments.

Tox will automatically create the necessary virtual environments, install the specified dependencies, and execute the commands defined in each section.

### Conclusion
Tox is a powerful tool that simplifies and automates common tasks in software development. By using Tox, you can improve code quality, save time, and ensure consistency in running tests and other tasks across different environments. Give Tox a try in your next project and experience the benefits of automation!
